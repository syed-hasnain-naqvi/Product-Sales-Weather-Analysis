  MAE  = 207.70

Product 45:
  RMSE = 270.79
  MAE  = 212.50

--- Decision Tree Models ---
Product 5:
  RMSE = 315.93
  MAE  = 256.82

Product 9:
  RMSE = 269.12
  MAE  = 213.42

===============================================
 Notes:
 - Linear Regression models generally performed better than Decision Trees 
   in terms of RMSE/MAE.
 - Product 9 showed the best model performance overall.
 - Weekend effect and temperature are significant predictors across products.
